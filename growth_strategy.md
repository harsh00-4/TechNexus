Now that TechNexus is live, here is your roadmap to growth.

## 1. SEO & Organic Traffic (Free)
*   **Keywords:** We've already added meta tags for "hackathons", "student developer", etc.
*   **Content:** The "News Feed" automatically generates fresh content daily. Search engines LOVE fresh content.
*   **Backlinks:** Post your link on:
    *   Reddit (r/webdev, r/reactjs, r/csmajors)
    *   Dev.to (Write an article "I built a platform for students")
    *   Product Hunt (Launch it properly!)

## 2. Community Marketing 🗣️
*   **College WhatsApp Groups:** Share it with your classmates. "Hey guys, found this cool site for hackathons."
*   **LinkedIn:** Post about your journey building it. Tag #MERN #WebDev #OpenSource.
*   **Discord Servers:** Join student tech communities (like 100xDevs, Harkirat's server, etc.) and share it in #showcase.

## 3. Viral Features (Built-in) 🚀
*   **"Verified" Badge:** Students trust verified content. Emphasize this.
*   **Problem Arena:** Encourage users to vote. People love sharing their opinions.
*   **Leaderboard (Future Idea):** Gamify the experience.

## 4. Monetization (Optional) 💰
*   **Sponsored Hackathons:** Charge companies to pin their hackathon at the top.
*   **Premium Mentorship:** Charge for AI career advice (using the Chatbot).
